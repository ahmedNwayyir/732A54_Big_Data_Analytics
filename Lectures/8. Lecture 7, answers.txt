Dear all,

As promised, here are the solutions to the group activity and the quizzes that
we have done in today's lecture session.

* Slide 5: A possible option would be to use the modulo function with value
10. Another option would be to simply use the last digit of each year value as
its hash value.

* Slide 6:  10

* Slide 8:  4
- Statement 1 is *not* correct because choosing one node to be the master for
all database objects would mean that this node would need to hold the complete
database, which is not what we want because it defies the purpose of using a
distributed system.
- Statement 2 is *not* correct because the, whenever the database object is
written at the node that is the master for this object, this master propagates
the write to the slaves which then update their copy.
- Statement 3 is *not* correct cause the master node can also be used for
reading.
- Statement 4 is correct because we may have a master-slave system that
guarantees only the BASE properties.

* Slide 9:  4
- Statement 1 is *not* correct because replicating all database objects to all
nodes means that all nodes would end up with a full copy of the whole
database, which is typically not what we want because it defies the purpose of
using a distributed system.
- Statement 2 is *not* correct because we may read any database object at any
node that has a replica of the object. Notice, however, that some nodes may
give you an outdated copy of the database object unless the system guarantees
string consistency.
- Statement 3 is *not* correct because multi-master replication does *not*
prevent dynamic scale out.
- Statement 4 is correct because with the suitable read quorums and write
quorums we can achieve strong consistency in a multi-master system.

* Slide 12:  1

* Slide 17:  C
For read consistency we need to satisfy R+W>N where N=5 and R=2.

* Slide 18:  B
For write consistency we need to satisfy 2*W>N where N=5.
